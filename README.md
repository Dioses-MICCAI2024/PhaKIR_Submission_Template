# PhaKIR Submission Template 
![PhaKIR](https://phakir.re-mic.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Phakir-Logo-1.png)

Welcome to our [PhaKIR - Challenge: **Pha**se, **K**eypoint and **I**nstrument **R**ecognition](https://phakir.re-mic.de/)! In this challenge, you are required to provide a Docker image. The resulting container processes data from an input directory and writes the results to an output directory. We have provided a `docker-compose.yml` file to simulate the evaluation environment and test resource limitations.

You can use this repository as an evaluation template for all three [PhaKIR-Tasks.](https://phakir.re-mic.de/tasks/)

- Surgical Procedure Phase Recognition
- Surgical Instrument Keypoint Estimation
- Surgical Instrument Instance Segmentation

This repository will help you to get started with the challenge. 
You will find information about the [Data](#data) for both training and submission.
To participate in the challenge, you have to provide a Docker image to process the data provided. You can find information about the requirements for the Docker environment in the [Docker](#docker) section.
The [Testing and Constraints](#testing-and-constraints) section provides information about the constraints of the evaluation environment.
The [Submission](#submission) section provides information about the submission formalities.
The [Evaluation](#evaluation) section provides information about the evaluation process.

```

Feel free to modify the repository structure. to suit your requirements.
Keep in mind that the `my_code` and `my_model` directories are copied to the `/phakir` directory in the container. If you change the directory structure, please adjust the `Dockerfile` accordingly.

## Data

The data for this challenge is organized in a specific manner. There are [Data Descriptions and Labeling Instructions](https://phakir.re-mic.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PhaKIR_Data_Description_and_Labeling_Instructions_v1.pdf). You will find the data mounted in the `input_data` directory. The results of your processing should be written to the `output_data` directory.

In the **submission phase**, the video data is already split into frames and available in the `/Frames` directory. In addition, the video cuts are provided.
The data is organized as follows:

```bash
input_data
│
├─── Video_01
│    ├─── Frames
│    │    ├─── frame_000000.png
│    │    ├─── frame_000001.png
│    │    └─── ...
│    └─── Video_01_Cuts.csv
│
├─── Video_02
│    ├─── Frames
│    │    ├─── frame_000000.png
│    │    ├─── frame_000001.png
│    │    └─── ...
│    └─── Video_01_Cuts.csv
```

You have to process each video in the `input_data/data` directory and write the results to the `output_data` directory. The results have to meet the requirements of the specific task.

### Outputs

## Docker

You are required to provide a Docker image for submission. A container created out of this image is used to process the provided data. Your Docker container should be configured to read data from the `input_data` directory and write the results to the `output_data` directory.

### Image

To create a Docker image, you can use the provided `Dockerfile`. The given `Dockerfile` is configured to install the necessary dependencies and copy the contents of your project (code and model, `my_code/` and `my_model/` folders, respectively) to the `/phakir` directory in the container. You can modify the `Dockerfile` to suit your requirements.

### Testing and Constraints

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided to simulate the evaluation environment, including resource limitations. Please ensure your solution works within these constraints.
The constraints are as follows:

- Shared memory size (`shm_size`): 40G
- :zap: Network mode: none &rarr; the container **will not** have network access, so be sure that all dependencies are added / copied during [image creation](#image). This prohibits downloading any additional weights or models.
- Memory limit: 32G
- GPU access: Yes &rarr; the container will have access to an NVIDIA RTX 3090 with 24G VRAM

| :zap:        Note: This limitations are only for the evaluation environment.
|-----------------------------------------|

As the training process is performed locally at your research facilities, you are free to use whatever you like to train the models. You are only required to use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file with the given restrictions to verify that your submission is conformant to the PhaKIR Challenge environment.

Note that the container must be able to process the data without any further input. The container must be able to process the data from the `input_data` directory and write the results to the `output_data` directory.

For testing just use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

You are only allowed to submit **one** docker image. If you want to participate in multiple tasks, you have to submit a single docker image that can handle those tasks.

| :zap:        It is your own responsibility to ensure that the Docker container works as expected.   |
|-----------------------------------------|

## Submission

Please submit your docker image according to the following guidelines:

A description of the submission formalities etc. will be published **soon**.
Check the [PhaKIR - Challenge: **Pha**se, **K**eypoint and **I**nstrument **R**ecognition](https://phakir.re-mic.de/) for new updates.

You can create your Docker Image using the provided `Dockerfile` or by providing a pre-built image. 
Make sure your Docker container is properly configured to read from the `input_data` directory and write to the `output_data` directory.

## Evaluation

Your submission will be evaluated based on the accuracy and efficiency of your results. Please ensure your solution works within the [resource constraints](#testing-and-constraints) defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

More information about the evaluation (e.g. metrics) will be added soon.
Check the [PhaKIR - Challenge: **Pha**se, **K**eypoint and **I**nstrument **R**ecognition](https://phakir.re-mic.de/) for new updates.

Have Fun and Good Luck! :rocket:
