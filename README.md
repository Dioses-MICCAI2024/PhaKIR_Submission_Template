# PhaKIR_Submission_Template
PhaKIR Submission Template 

## Overview

Welcome to our [PhaKIR - Challenge: **Pha**se, **K**eypoint and **I**nstrument **R**ecognition](https://phakir.re-mic.de/)! In this challenge, you are required to provide a Docker container that processes data from an input directory and writes the results to an output directory. We have provided a `docker-compose.yml` file to simulate the evaluation environment and test resource limitations.


You can use this repository as an evaluation template for all three [PhaKIR-Tasks.](https://phakir.re-mic.de/tasks/)
- Surgical Procedure Phase Recognition
- Surgical Instrument Keypoint Estimation
- Surgical Instrument Instance Segmentation

This repository helps you to get started with the challenge. 
You will find information about the [Data](#data) for the training as well as for the submission.
To participate in the challenge you have to provide a Docker container that processes the provided data. You can find information about the requirements for the Docker container in the [Docker Container](#docker-container) section.
The [Testing and Constraints](#testing-and-constraints) section provides information about the constraints of the evaluation environment.
The [Submission](#submission) section provides information about the submission formalities.
The [Evaluation](#evaluation) section provides information about the evaluation process.

## Data

The data for this challenge is organized in a specific manner. There are [Data Descriptions and Labeling Instructions](https://phakir.re-mic.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PhaKIR_Data_Description_and_Labeling_Instructions_v1.pdf). You will find the data mounted in the `input_data` directory. The results of your processing should be written to the `output_data` directory.

In the submission phase, the video data is already split and available in the `/Frames` directory. Additionally, the video cuts are provided.
The data is organized as follows:
```bash
input_data
│
└───data
    │
    └───Video_01
    │   │   Frames
    │   │   Video_01_Cuts.csv
    │
    └───Video_02
        │   Frames
        │   Video_02_Cuts.csv
```

You are required to process each video in the `input_data/data` directory and write the results to the `output_data` directory. The results have to fit the requirements of the specific task.

### Surgical Procedure Phase Recognition
If you participate in this task, please provide the phase information for every frame.
Details can be found in [Data Description and Labeling Instructions](https://phakir.re-mic.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PhaKIR_Data_Description_and_Labeling_Instructions_v1.pdf).
Compare your results with the provided ground truth from the training data.
```bash
output_data
│
└───Video_01
│   │   Video_01_Phases.csv
│
└───Video_02
    │   Video_02_Phases.csv
```
### Surgical Instrument Keypoint Estimation
If you participate in this task, please provide the keypoints for every 25th frame in the required encoding.
Details can be found in [Data Description and Labeling Instructions](https://phakir.re-mic.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PhaKIR_Data_Description_and_Labeling_Instructions_v1.pdf).
Compare your results with the provided ground truth from the training data.

```bash
output_data
│
└───Video_01
│   │   Video_01_Keypoints.json
│
└───Video_02
    │   Video_02_Keypoints.json
```

### Surgical Instrument Instance Segmentation
If you participate in this task, please provide every 25th mask in the required encoding for each frame.
Details can be found in [Data Description and Labeling Instructions](https://phakir.re-mic.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PhaKIR_Data_Description_and_Labeling_Instructions_v1.pdf).
Compare your results with the provided ground truth from the training data.

```bash
output_data
│
└───Video_01
│   └─── Video_01_Masks
│        └─── 0
│        │    └─── frame_000000.png
│        │    └─── frame_000025.png
│        │    └─── frame_000050.png
│        └─── 1000
│        │    └─── frame_001000.png
│        │    └─── frame_001025.png
│
└───Video_02
│   └─── Video_02_Masks
│        └─── 0
│        │    └─── frame_000000.png
│        │    └─── frame_000025.png
│        │    └─── frame_000050.png
```


## Docker Container
You are required to provide a Docker image. A container created out of this image is used to process the provided data. Your Docker container should be configured to read data from the `input_data` directory and write the results to the `output_data` directory.

### Image

To create a Docker image, you can use the provided `Dockerfile`. The `Dockerfile` is configured to install the necessary dependencies and copy the contents of your project (code and model) to the `/phakir` directory in the container. You can modify the `Dockerfile` to suit your requirements.

### Compose / Constraints
To simulate the evaluation we provided a `docker-compose.yml` file. This file is configured to simulate the evaluation environment, including resource limitations. Please ensure your solution works within these constraints.
The constraints are as follows:

- Shared memory size (`shm_size`): 40G
- :zap: Network mode: none &rarr; The container will not have network access
  - This prohibits downloading any additional weights or models
- Memory limit: 32G
- GPU access: Yes (The container will have access to an NVIDIA RTX 3090 with 24G VRAM)


Mind, that the container must be able to process the data without any further input. The container must be able to process the data from the `input_data` directory and write the results to the `output_data` directory.

For testing just use the following command: 
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

It is only allowed to submit **one** docker image. If you want to participate in multiple tasks, you have to provide a single docker image that can handle these tasks.

| :zap:        It is your own responsibility to ensure that the Docker container works as expected.   |
|-----------------------------------------|

## Submission
Please submit your docker image according to the following guidelines: 

A description of the submission formalities etc. will be published **soon**.
Check the [PhaKIR - Challenge: **Pha**se, **K**eypoint and **I**nstrument **R**ecognition](https://phakir.re-mic.de/) for new updates.

You can create your Image with the provided `Dockerfile` or by providing a prebuilt image. Ensure that your Docker container is properly configured to read from the `input_data` directory and write to the `output_data` directory.


## Evaluation

Your submission will be evaluated based on the accuracy and efficiency of your results. Please ensure your solution works within the resource constraints defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

More information about the evaluation (e.g. metrics) will be added soon.
Check the [PhaKIR - Challenge: **Pha**se, **K**eypoint and **I**nstrument **R**ecognition](https://phakir.re-mic.de/) for new updates.

Have Fun and Good Luck! :rocket:
